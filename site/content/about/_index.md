+++

I´m an **architect**, pastry chef and coffee lover. I´m living in Barcelona, and absolutely love the city. I never though I would be able to live in the same city as Gaudí. I would like to design as him, but for now I´m in the path of learning. And my path takes me to the world of interior design, which is where I´m focusing right now.

Currently collaborating with **RAUM studio** as a freelance architect. This studio specializes on retail design, focusing on branding, interior design and mobile design.
