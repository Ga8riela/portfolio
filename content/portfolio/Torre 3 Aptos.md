Guatemala city, Guatemala

2012
<!--more-->

> This project was a group development at university. Due to the lack of parks and green areas in Zone 14 of the city of Guatemala, we visualized a public area where we could attract investors by developing mixed used buildings for the overall social improvement. After the urban proposal, each one of the group designed a building. My proposal was to take advantage of the morphology of the parking entrance, a circular ramp. The facade was based on the sun trajectory.

> This project was nominated for "Best projects of the architecture faculty UFM of 2012".
